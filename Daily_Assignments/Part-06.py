myList = [2, 3, 4]

# Display how many values are inside the array:
print(len(myList))

# Use a for loop to iterate thru and display each value of each index inside of the array:
for i in myList: print(i)

# Show the value of the third item:
print(myList[2])

# Show the value of the first:
print(myList[0])

# Add the number 5 onto the end of the array:
myList.append(5)

# Loop thru and display each of the values NOW in the new array:
for i in myList: print(i)

# Confirm the length of the new array:
len(myList)

# To show that the list is an array:
print(myList)
